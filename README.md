## Dataset
- Quarterly MRR Growth (2024):  
  - Q1: **3.86**  
  - Q2: **3.18**  
  - Q3: **8.13**  
  - Q4: **14.19**  
- **Average (must be correct): 7.34**  
- **Industry Target:** 15

---

## Key Findings
- The company’s **average MRR growth is 7.34%**, which is below the **industry benchmark of 15%**.
- H1 (Q1+Q2) was weak (3.86%, 3.18%), with recovery in H2 (Q3 8.13%, Q4 14.19%).
- Despite a strong Q4, the **yearly average remains ~51% below target** (7.34 vs 15).

---

## Business Implications
- Underperformance vs. peers risks **market share loss** and **slower cashflow for reinvestment**.
- The late-year rebound shows capability to grow, but **consistency** is missing.
- To meet investor expectations, the gap to 15% must be closed **sustainably** (not just a Q4 spike).

---

## Recommendation (Action Plan)
**Primary solution: _Expand into new market segments_**
- Identify underserved geographies and industries.
- Build tailored bundles for **SMEs and mid-market** segments.
- Localize onboarding, pricing, and support to reduce adoption friction.

**Supporting moves**
- **Acquisition:** Targeted campaigns and partnerships in new segments.
- **Conversion:** Optimize free→paid funnels and trial-to-subscription paths.
- **Retention/Upsell:** Tiered pricing, add-on packs, and lifecycle communications.
